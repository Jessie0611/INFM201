    Which of the 3 developers calls you more attention?
    <br> Did you see yourself in one of these professions?
    <br> What programming languages do you know? 
    <br> If you do not related to any of those, which one would you like to learn?
</b> <br> <br> 
    <br>
    I find myself wanting to be a full stack developer, but I do enjoy front-end development more than back-end. <br>
     I enjoy creating and designing webpages with interactive elements.
     <br> I currently know HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
     <br> I am enrolled in my first database course and I am learning SQL. 
     <br> I wish to learn Java, and more JavaScript as well as how to utilize the React library. 
     <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

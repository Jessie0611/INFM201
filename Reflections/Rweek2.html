<p><b>Explain Clien/Server Model. <br>
    What is a framework? <br>
    Resarch a specific framework and explain some of it's helpful resources.
<br></b> <br> <br>
    Client-Server model defines the roles and responsibilities of different components or entities within a networked system. The client sends a request for a specific service or resource to the server. The server processes the request, which may involve retrieving data from a database, performing calculations, or other tasks. The server sends the response back to the client. Servers can serve multiple client devices at once, and each client device sends requests to multiple servers while accessing and browsing the Internet.
<br> <br>
    A framework is a pre-built structure or set of tools and guidelines that provide a foundation for building applications or software systems. It's essentially a reusable and customizable template that helps developers streamline the development process, maintain consistency, and follow best practices. Frameworks typically include libraries, templates, and a set of rules or conventions for creating specific types of software.
 <br>  <br>
    Ruby on Rails is a popular web application framework for the Ruby programming language. The Rails API documentation is a comprehensive reference for all the classes and methods available in Rails. It's useful for developers looking for detailed information on specific components. The Ruby on Rails community is active on Stack Overflow. You can ask questions, find answers to common problems, and learn from others' experiences. Many developers and organizations maintain blogs and forums where they share insights, tips, and best practices. Learning Ruby on Rails is not just about understanding the framework but also about gaining proficiency in the Ruby programming language. Combining these resources with hands-on practice by building real-world projects is an effective way to become proficient in Ruby on Rails development.

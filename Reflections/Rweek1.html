        <b>Explain the steps of SDLC. </b><br>
        <b>Why is it essential to know about HCI and SDLC when coding applications?</b> <br>
        </b>  
        <br>
        <b>SDLC</b>provides a structured approach to software development. It outlines a series of phases that help developers through the entire project. This structure ensure that the project stays organized.
      <br> <br>
 By integrating <b>HCI</b> aspects, developers can ensure that the application not only meets technical 
 requirements but also supports the business goals by providing value to users. <b>HCI</b> leads to better UX design with interfaces that are visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate.

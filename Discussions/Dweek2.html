    <h1>WEEK TWO DISCUSSION</h1>

<hr>
<p> <b>Discussion Topic:</b> <br>
    In this weeks reading we talked about frameworks for developing. Some examples are Vue, React and Vanilla.
    <br>  Research about the frameworks and choose 2 that you like according to what you found.
    <br>  Explain the Pros and Con of the framework and the features that call your attention.
</p>
<br>
<p> <b>My Reply:</b> <br>
I have been hearing a lot about React lately.
React was created by the developers at Facebook, and is used by Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and more.
 React is an open-source JavaScript library that builds interactive user-interfaces. Reacts structure is a 
 single-page application that is used to load different components, this method is said to decrease load times.
   React uses multiple independent and reusable components that are composed together to create a more complex 
   user-interface. These components are things like the navigation bar, a profile, or a social media news feed 
   that contains smaller components of post or tweets. When components like “Likes” are changed by users they 
   are automatically re-rendered, and the data is updated.  There is a slight learning curve to using react 
   because you must know JavaScript XML (JSX).

 <br> 
Vue is very similar to React in the way that it functions, but is the newest framework that was created in 2014 by Evan You, a former Google employers. I feel that this aspect gives it some respect as it seems more of a small-town business than a large corporation. The pro for this is that there is no rush to push out new developments, and because it is created and maintained by regular people that listen closer to user feedback, because, well, they experience these issues themselves. Vue also builds on top of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

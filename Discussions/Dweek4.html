<p><b>Discussion Topic:</b> <br>
    This week we talk about the databases, databases management system and the relationship with SDLC.  This is a back end development.  According to the readings the the database develop goes in hand with the SDLC but some writers said the the main part of the database in the implementation.  What is your opinion about this?  It is something that must be part of all the process or only important in the deploy?

<b>My Reply:</b> <br>
A database is a structured collection of data organized for storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are created using tables and relationships between data elements with Structured Query Language (SQL). Much like the previously covered Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the Database Development Life Cycle (DDLC) is a process of designing, implementing, and maintaining a database system. The DDLC is used to improve user experience and create a better production and inventory management system for a company. In software development, it's important to think about your database needs during the planning and design phase. It is better to plan for your projects database requirements from the beginning alongside the SDLC process. Waiting until later stages like deployment will delay your projectâ€™s release if there is not a proper database system.

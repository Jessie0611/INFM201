<h1>WEEK  ONE  DISCUSSION</h1>
<hr>
<hr>
<p> <b>Discussion Topic:</b>
    <br> This week you read about HCI and SDLC.Both have multiple characteristics that can be used in software development.
    <br>Which ones are the most important for this class?
    <br> (This is a personal opinion but remember to use 2 references to support your point of view.)</p>
<br>
<p>HCI and SDLC are two critical aspects of software development, each with its own set of characteristics that contribute to the overall success of a software project. Important aspects of HCI is the user interface and experience, user feedback, and accessibility. The user should find the design is easy to navigate and accessible across multiple devices. Important SDLC characteristics are the planning, in-depth testing, and maintenance and enhancing. It is important to test out the software before you deploy it all as a finished product. There may be errors such as broken path ways and functions that you miss without proper testing.  Maintenance and enhancements are also important to keep the software up to date with technology advancements and current trends. An exceptional webpage or software requires a balance between HCI considerations and SDLC principles. It is important that your application functions correctly and also has a user-friendly design that meets the needs of its intended audience.

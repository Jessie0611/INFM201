    <h1>WEEK THREE DISCUSSION</h1>

<hr>
<p> <b>Discussion Topic:</b> <br>
    I know as developer that I still need more training in some areas. That is one shortcoming of the full stack developer. How do you see yourself?  As full stack, back end or front end?  As you progress in the courses you will interact with all the aspects of the front and back end.  In this discussion review the front end and the back end developer. What are the shortcomings? What is the most interesting part of the area you choose?  What do you think is the are you will need improve?

<b>My Reply:</b> <br>
Based on my current knowledge and experience I see myself as more of a front-end developer. Front-end developers are responsible for building the elements of a website that users interact with directly, including the layout, design, and functionality of web pages.  I like to create webpages and manipulate the elements into cool designs with little quirks, such as tilting or spinning images. Designing the webpage is the most interesting part to me. I would love to learn more JavaScript aspects, as I am fairly new to that language. I feel like being able to create a unique, interactive, and responsive website from scratch is an awesome skillset to have. However, I aspire to one day be a full stack developer who is familiar with all aspects of creating apps and websites. Back-end development handles the behind-the-scenes functionality that makes those interactions possible. Collaboration between front-end and back-end development is critical to delivering a seamless and responsive web experience for users. I am currently enrolled in both the required database classes this semester. Database Concepts 1 class is going well so far, but there is still more to learn to be a great full stack developer. Choosing to be a full stack developer means that you will be working on bigger projects. As a student who is working and picking up extra classes, I say bring on the workload.

            <B>Discussion Topic:</B> <br> 
            After reading the different code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
            <br> Why is ethics an important part of the profession and you as a student?
        <br> <br> 
                <B>My Reply: </B> <br>
        Ethics plays an important role in software development, and this importance extends to students studying software development. Ethical considerations ensure that developers create products that improve the well-being of society rather than harm it. Ethical software development creates trust between the developers and its users. As a student aspiring to become a software developer, understanding and practicing ethical principles is a fundamental part of my professional development. It reflects my commitment to professionalism and responsible conduct in my career.
